Coffee shop database management system

Mission Statement
Our mission is to create a database for a small coffee shop, The Station. The business
has recently gained traction after introducing a new brand of coffee from a new supplier,
and are thinking of expanding to two additional locations. The operations and
management of the business is currently being done with excel spreadsheets thereby
requiring a lot of time and labor. Given the many moving parts of the business such as
scheduling, keeping track of inventory and distribution of resources in their business,
we will be creating a database that would consolidate all the aspects of the
business.Our goal is to create an efficient centralized database to solve all the
inefficiencies, increase revenue, while minimizing cost.
Summary of Problem
For small businesses in a growing market, minimizing cost and maximizing resources is
highly critical. From ensuring that the business remains competitive with limited
resources to reinvesting in the business, critical analysis and efficient systems that
communicate and interact with each other becomes crucial.
Our Client owns and operates a small community shop in Beacon Hill called The
Station. The owners of the business are exploring the option of expanding to additional
locations. As it stands right now, they use Excel to keep track of their inventory as well
as their scheduling. Fortunately, they use a third party vendor, Square to process credit 
and debit card payments from clients. As the business continues to grow, they are
quickly realizing the growing need to keep track of the many moving parts of their
business and how excel is proving to be not as efficient. They have also started
sourcing a new brand of coffee from a different country which has gained some traction
from their clients but they have not been able to track how much of their recent profits
are attributed to the new brand of coffee.
Additionally, with any expansion, they need to monitor cost, asset/resource allocations,
staffing, inventory, overhead cost at their different locations, Shipping and Delivery, and
Payments etc . The new database system will add value to the business by mitigating
and eliminating these issues thereby keeping business profitable. Once the database is
implemented, the management team would spend less time around the minute details
of their business and focus more on strategic aspects of their business.
